              Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel, is a cold and mountainous region. It is known for its dragons, and its inhabitants, the Nords.
              Which large, winged, fire-breathing creatures are known to live in Skyrim?
            expected_response: "Dragons"

          - input: |
              The Nords long ago divided the province into nine geopolitical regions known as holds. Each hold is a large area of land roughly equivalent to a county in Cyrodiil, each individually governed by a jarl who maintains court in the hold's capital city.
              The nine traditional holds of Skyrim are: Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, the Pale, Winterhold, Eastmarch, the Rift, Whiterun, Falkreath, and the Reach. 
              During the Interregnum, when the Reach became an independent Reachman kingdom and lost its status as a Nordic hold, a tenth hold named Karthald was created from the Reach's northern fringe.
              What are the names of the nine traditional holds of Skyrim?
            expected_response: "Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, the Pale, Winterhold, Eastmarch, the Rift, Whiterun, Falkreath, and the Reach."

          - input: |
              Solitude is the capital city of both Haafingar Hold, and the province of Skyrim. Currently ruled by Jarl Elisif the Fair, widow of the late High King Torygg, it is the headquarters of the Imperial Legion stationed in Skyrim. 
              General Tullius commands the Imperial army from the stone-walled Castle Dour with his second-in-command, Legate Rikke, while Solitude's Jarl, Elisif, resides in the Blue Palace. 
              The Thalmor have an embassy hidden in the nearby mountains. What is the capital of Skyrim?
            expected_response: "Solitude"

          - input: |
              A garrison town on the northern coast of Skyrim, the port of Dawnstar is the trade center of the region. Dawnstar is one of the northern most cities in Skyrim along with Solitude and Winterhold. Where is Dawnstar located?

              Oh, there once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, Who came riding to Whiterun from old Rorikstead. And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, As he told of bold battles and gold he had made. 
              But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, When he met the shield-maiden Matilda, who said. 
              Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead, Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed! 
              And so then came clashing and slashing of steel, As the brave lass Matilda charged in, full of zeal. And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no more - When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!
              What happened to Ragnar the Red?
            expected_response: "Ragnar the Red was killed by Matilda."

              Nords (also known as Northmen, or called Bron singular in the Language of Dragons) are the Children of the Sky, a race of tall and fair-haired humans from Skyrim who are known for their incredible resistance to cold and magical frost. 
              They are fierce, strong and enthusiastic warriors, and many become renowned warriors, soldiers and mercenaries all over Tamriel. 
              Eager to augment their martial skills beyond the traditional methods of Skyrim, they excel in all manner of warfare, and are known as a militant people by their neighbors.
              Nords were known for a time for their nautical prowess when they migrated from Atmora.
              How would you describe the Nords?
            expected_response: "Nords are a race of tall and fair-haired humans from Skyrim who are known for their incredible resistance to cold and magical frost. They are fierce, strong and enthusiastic warriors."

              Lycanthropy is a condition in Skyrim that gives you the Beast Form greater power, which allows you to take on the form of a werewolf. 
              Becoming a werewolf adds the Beast Blood constant effect, which grants a resistance to all diseases, but also prevents you from gaining resting bonuses. 
              Werewolves can deal lethal damage with their claw attacks, move swiftly, and have increased health and stamina. You can become a werewolf by drinking werewolf blood.
              How can you become a werewolf?
            expected_response: "You can become a werewolf by drinking werewolf blood."

              Alteration is one of the six schools of magic. Spells in this school change the world around the caster so normal physical truths no longer hold. 
              It is sometimes confused with Illusion magic, as both schools seek to change normal truths. 
              Illusion magic, however, is not bound by the laws of nature but Alteration magic is. 
              The power of Alteration comes from the fact that the nature of its changes applies to all, whereas Illusion magic affects only the caster and the target. 
              What does Alteration magic do?
            expected_response: "Alteration magic changes the world around the caster so normal physical truths no longer hold."

              Smithing can only be performed at certain locations such as a Blacksmith's shop. In these designated areas you may find several types of tools: 
              Grindstone: Sharpen weapons for extra damage. The higher your Smithing skill, the more the weapon damage is improved. 
              Workbench: Allows you to improve armor. The higher your smithing skill, the more the armor rating is improved 
              Forge or Anvil: Create new weapons and armor from raw materials. 
              What can you do with a Grindstone?
            expected_response: "Sharpen weapons for extra damage."

              Chaurus are medium-to-large, hostile, earwig-like creatures found in swamps, marshlands, and deep underground caverns. They vigorously project a strong acidic poison (spell Chaurus Spit, 7 pts for 7 seconds), which can quickly eat through most armor. 
              They can cling to walls and have large amounts of health. Chaurus are often found in the company of Falmer, who breed them for their chitin. The Dawnguard add-on adds Chaurus Hunters and Chaurus Hunter Fledglings (along with Chaurus Cocoons), which have apparently transformed from regular Chaurus. 
              They hover over the ground and have much higher health than even the fearsome Chaurus Reaper, and spit their poison at a much faster rate than regular Chaurus. This poison spit also travels farther than regular Chaurus spit.
              In a recipe book for chaurus pie, the author recommends that if hunting them, you should 'get yourself some good armor and a nice big sword, and [...] some stout men who won't run off at the first sign of trouble.'
              The suggestion to use melee force against them seems well-founded, because they are less likely to poison you with their melee attacks.
              Where are Chaurus found?
            expected_response: "Chaurus are found in swamps, marshlands, and deep underground caverns."
